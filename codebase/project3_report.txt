2. Meta-data page in an index file
- Show your meta-data page of an index design if you have any. 
We store rootID, attrType(TypeInt, TypeReal, TypeVarChar), d(order), attrLen, firstLeafID(for scan) in meta-data page. These meta-data is all for B-tree.

3. Index Entry Format
- Show your index entry design (structure). 
In the index file, the rootID is stored at page 0, which is meta-data page. Each index node(page) and leaf page are stored by pre-order of the B-tree in the file. For example, 1st leaf->2nd leaf->…->nth leaf->parent of these n leaves->…->last leaf. From the B-tree point of view, the file is connected and accessed starting from the root node, and then its children, which are index nodes, and at last all the leaf nodes (if depth>=3). And leaf nodes with the same parent are implemented as a doubly linked list, which can be easily accessed by the leftSibling ID and rightSibling ID.


4. Page Format
- Show your internal-page (non-leaf node) design.
------------  
|meta-data |  Meta-data: nodeID, nodeType(Leaf, Index), attrType, attrLen,
|----------|             deleteMark, d
|childList |
|----------|
|   keys   |
|----------|

- Show your leaf-page (leaf node) design.
------------
|meta-data |  Meta-data: nodeID, nodeType(Leaf, Index), attrType, attrLen,
|----------|             deleteMark, d, rightSibling, leftSibling
|   keys   |
|----------|
|   RIDs   |
|----------|

5. Implementation Detail
- Have you added your own source file (.cc or .h)?
No, but we add two classes: Btree, BtreeNode

- Have you implemented non-lazy deletion? Choose Yes or No: 
No

- Have you implemented duplicated key handling that can span multiple pages? Choose Yes or No: 
  If yes, please explain briefly how you have implemented this feature.

- Other implementation details:
We implement two classes, Btree and BtreeNode, to construct the structure of index file. Class Btree controls the method of all tree, such as createNode, insertEntry(by recursive) and class BtreeNode controls the method of each node, such as insertIndex (to each node). In each BtreeNode, it has nodePage[PAGE_SIZE] that can flush data to disk. After we insert/delete entry to the node, we write the data to this nodePage and then write it to disk. We can see this as an abstract layer to help us implement Btree easier.

We use d to control the size of data to ensure it will be always less than PAGE_SIZE if there is no duplicate key. We separate the page into three parts as in the page format plot above. Though it is easier to implement, the drawback is that it may waste space if the data is TypeVarChar and the size of data less than attribute.length, since we assume all the data will be its maximun length and calculate d as this condition.
